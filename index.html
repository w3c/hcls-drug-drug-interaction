Ensuring medication therapy occurs safely and to the maximum benefit
for any given patient is of great interest to clinicians
[[institute-medicine-2006]]. One possible threat to patient safety comes
from exposure to two or more drugs that are known to interact (i.e.,
potential drug-drug interactions or PDDIs), and could therefore lead
to a clinically observable effect on the patient (i.e., an actual
drug-drug interaction).  New information regarding
PDDIs is published every day in primary sources such as drug product
labeling and the scientific literature. However, there are currently
no broadly accepted standards to guide these experts in the
organization and presentation of PDDI information for clinical decision support. These shortcomings suggest
the need for harmonized approaches for documenting and sharing PDDI
information. The purpose of this Community Group Note is to
provide a technical and user-centered foundation for a minimum
information model for PDDI information. The resulting common
representation of PDDI summaries would facilitate curation and
information exchange. Downstream applications would process these
representations into forms amenable for clinical decision support,
drug product label enhancement, cohort identification, and other
pharmacovigilance activities.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Ensuring medication therapy occurs safely and to the maximum benefit for of any given patient is of great
    interest to clinicians [[institute-medicine-2006]]. One possible threat to patient safety comes from exposure
    to two or more drugs that are known to interact (i.e., potential drug-drug interactions or PDDIs), and could therefore
    lead to a clinically observable effect on the patient (i.e., an actual drug-drug interaction). While the effects
    that may occur due to exposure to some PDDIs can benefit patients (e.g., some HIV therapies use a low-dose of ritonavir
    to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered protease inhibitors by inhibiting their metabolism), PDDIs are
    more often a patient safety concern. Clinically important events attributable to PDDI exposure have been identified in multiple studies, with rates ranging from 
    5.3% - 14.3% of inpatients, and up to 231,000 emergency department visits each year in
    the United States alone [[magro-2012]][[cdc-faststats]]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 studies conducted
    on 3 continents found the median rate of PDDI associated hospital admissions to be 22.2%
    (interquartile range 16.6 - 36.0%) [[dechanont-2014]]. The potential for harm from PDDIs is an international concern reflected in 
    guidance documents of regulatory agencies around the world [[rekic-2017]][[european-medicines-2012]][[usdhhs-2017]]. Moreover, in the United States, PDDI alerting is a criteria included in the so-called Meaningful Use criteria
    for Electronic Health Records [[cms-2013]][[ridgely-2012]]), and population-based strategies for tracking exposure
    are promoted by organizations such as the Pharmacy Quality Alliance [[ahrq-drug-drug]].
  </p>
  <p>
    Clinicians often face barriers to the effective and appropriate management of PDDI exposures [[nabovati-2017]].
    Barriers include PDDI alerts with poor specificity and incomplete personal PDDI knowledge [[abarca-2004]][[van-der-sijs-2006]].
    An awareness of the need for PDDI decision support prompts clinicians to use various drug
    knowledge resources including print or online drug information references, drug interaction checking tools, and alerting systems.
    Unfortunately, poor specificity leads clinicians to be overwhelmed by PDDI information that is “difficult to retrieve, sort and
    digest into clinical decision making” [[bottiger-2009]]. PDDI alerts are often  criticized for “over-alerting” that
    obfuscates the most important information, hinders the usability of the decision support system, and leads to alert fatigue
    and clinician dissatisfaction [[bottiger-2009]][[payne-2015]]. Moreover, while many compilations of
    PDDI evidence exist to help improve prescriber and pharmacist knowledge, they are not concordant in their coverage,
    accuracy, and agreement [[wang-2010]][[saverno-2011]][[ayvaz-2015]][[fung-2017]]. Together, these
    shortcomings suggest the need for harmonized approaches for documenting and sharing PDDI information.
  </p>
  <section>
    <h2>Need, envisioned workflow, and high-level requirements</h2>
    <p>New information regarding PDDIs is published every day in primary sources such as drug product labeling and the scientific
      literature. A PubMed search for publications indexed with the Medical Subject Headings keyword “Drug interactions” shows an
      average of 3,970 publications per year from 2000 through 2016. This suggests that the body of evidence about PDDIs is
      overwhelming and dynamic. As it is impossible for clinicians to keep up with the PDDI evidence base, drug
      experts generate summaries of PDDI evidence from primary sources. These summaries bring PDDI knowledge to clinicians
      in the form of published drug information compendium, clinical decision support rules, and interaction checking applications.
      <strong>However, there are currently no broadly accepted standards to guide these experts in the organization and presentation of PDDI
        information.</strong>
    </p>

    <p><a href="#PDDI-MI-APPLICATIONS"></a> provides an overview of
      the roles envisioned for a PDDI minimal information model.  Drug
      experts would generate summaries of PDDI evidence from primary
      sources using the information elements from the PDDI minimal
      information model. The information elements would cover the
      minimum set of information required for the effective clinical
      management of PDDI exposure. The resulting common representation
      of PDDI summaries would facilitate curation and information
      exchange. Downstream applications would process these
      representations into forms amenable for clinical decision
      support, drug product label enhancement, cohort identification,
      and other pharmacovigilance activities. To achieve the
      envisioned roles, the minimal information model must be flexible
      and computable. Where possible, model elements should draw upon
      accepted biomedical taxonomies and ontologies to represent
      medications, diagnoses, and descriptions of potential adverse
      reactions. Preferring the use of ontologies over free-text
      descriptions will reduce ambiguity associated with free-text,
      thus supporting comparison and computational
      analyses. Representations in commonly-used formats (JSON, XML/RDF, 
      etc.) will support ease of construction and parsing of models,
      particularly through shared libraries and APIs.

    </figure>

    <p>The purpose of this Community Group Note is to provide a
      technical and user-centered foundation for a minimum
      information model for PDDI information. The principal
      contributions include:
      <ol>
	      
	<li>definitions for the model's core information items,
	  examples of using these definitions to represent two PDDIs,
	  and a set of additional PDDIs selected as case studies for
	  future work on the information model;</li>
	<li>clarification on the intended users of the information model
	  along with use stories and specific information needs; and</li>
	<li>a statement on the appropriate scope of knowledge representation
	  for the information model.</li>
      </ol>

    The focus of this document is definition of the model, not
    representation. Although this document provides preliminary XML
    examples of the use of the model to represent PDDI information
    (see <a href="#appendix-xml"></a>), detailed representational
    issues are not discussed in this document. Planned future efforts
    will address these questions.

 <p>
These core information elements are consistent with the results of a separate international Delphi study on how
      to improve the delivery of medication alerts within computerized physician order entry systems [[riedmann-2011]].
      This suggested list of core information elements includes some that are present in one or more of the 15 PDDI conceptual
      models analyzed in a recent comprehensive review by Herrero-Zazo, Segura-Bedmar, and Martínez [[herrero-zazo-2016]].
      However, there is little commonality across the conceptual models on those elements that are included and no single
      conceptual model covers all 9 of the information elements. For example, the mechanism of the interaction and clinical
      consequences were present in multiple models but at different levels of granularity. Other information elements, such
      as frequency of exposure and frequency of harm are not present in any of the 15 sources. Even PDDI knowledge bases that
      are strongly clinically-oriented (as opposed to  knowledge bases oriented toward use in bioinformatics or drug development)
      use considerably different information elements. For example, the National Drug File - Reference Terminology (NDF-RT)
      produced by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs [[olvey-2010]] includes detailed information about pharmacokinetic
      mechanisms but does not discuss clinical consequences. In contrast, the system reported by Mille, Degoulet, and Jaulent
      [[mille-2007]] provided details on the clinical consequences, including risk increasing and mitigating factors,
      but supplied only a limited structure for mechanism.

 <p>Although not used by practitioners and clinicians, seriousness is
 an important concept for pharmacovigilance and
 pharmacoepidemiological studies. The adoption of this term aligns
 this effort with definitions adopted by the World Health
 Organization[[who-umc-glossary]], the United States Food and Drug
 Administration [[usdhhs-2011]], and other organizations involved in
 pharmacovigilance efforts.

  <h2>Background and use cases</h2>

    <h2>The overarching use case for the minimum information model</h2>
    <p>
      The overarching use case for a minimum information model for
      representing PDDI information in a clinical context
      is <strong>to provide a technical foundation for effective PDDI
      clinical decision support</strong>. Unfortunately, existing drug
      information sources systems generally organize information into
      a more or less narrative format includes only some of the core
      PDDI information elements. To illustrate, consider the PDDI
      between oral anticoagulants and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) reported in the well-curated French Interactions
      médicamenteuses PDDI dataset [[ansm-2016]] shown
      in <a href="#NSAID-Example"></a>.
    </p>
    <figure id="NSAID-Example">
      <img src="W3C-Images/NSAID-Example.png">
      <figcaption>PDDI example from a French compendium</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The PDDI narrative shown is structured into short and easy-to-read description and management
      sections. However, much of the information in the proposed minimum information model is either not structured
      or not provided:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Drugs Involved</em> - textual, non-standardized, non-coded lists of ingredients that have been
        classified as either NSAIDs or as oral anticoagulants</li>
      <li><em>Clinical consequences</em> - textual, non-standardized, non-coded mention of “hemorrhage” </li>
      <li><em>Frequency of exposure to the PDDI</em> - no mention </li>
      <li><em>Frequency of harm for persons who have been exposed to the PDDI</em> - no mention</li>
      <li><em>Contextual information/modifying factors</em> - no mention</li>
      <li><em>Evidence</em> - no mention</li>
      <li><em>Mechanism of the interaction</em> - textual, non-standardized, mention of gastroduodenal irritation by the NSAID</li>
      <li><em>Recommended actions</em> - avoidance if possible, monitoring otherwise</li>
      <li><em>Seriousness rating</em> - not explicit. However, the statement “not recommended” would suggest a risk of clinically significant consequence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As is evident from the listing above, there are four minimum information items that are not provided in the
      narrative (contextual information, frequency of exposure, frequency of harm, and evidence). Contextual information
      would include drug and patient characteristics factors that might increase or mitigate the risk of harm from exposure
      to the interaction drug pair. Such information often complements, and sometimes is based on , information on the
      frequency information items (frequency of exposure to the PDDI and frequency of harm for exposed persons who have
      been exposed). Together, these information items help to inform the clinician about the risk-benefit trade-off of PDDI
      exposure. In fact, it has been shown that effective clinical decision support that improves patient outcomes can be
      built using such information. For example, Tamblyn et al. found that a novel medication clinical decision support system
      that provided patient-specific risk estimates of injury due to falls reduced fall-related injury by 1.7 injuries per 1000
      patients (95% CI 0.2/1000 to 3.2/1000 p=0.02) [[tamblyn-2012]]. Conversely, when a PDDI summary provides no context
      about risk and no frequency information, only clinical decision support alerts based on  simple exposure to the drug
      combination can be built. This leads to highly sensitive but unspecific alerts and is a primary cause of alert fatigue and
      clinician dissatisfaction  [[van-der-sijs-2006]].
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, the PDDI narrative in <a href="#NSAID-Example"></a>
      provides information without citing supporting evidence.
      Previous community efforts concluded that “providing access to the evidence is a critical component
      of weighing the risks and benefits of co-prescribing drugs that have the potential to result in a drug-drug interaction”
      [[tilson-2016]]. Evidence in supporting PDDIs includes physiological and pharmacological observations from
      clinical studies; mechanistic knowledge derived from pre-clinical and clinical studies; and observational data
      including case reports and various non-randomized studies [[utecht-2017]][[brochhausen-2014]]. Evidence
      may be useful for establishing the existence of an interaction without providing information about the potential
      clinical effect. Other evidence can help to answer questions about the associated clinical effects and their magnitude,
      variability, and estimated frequency [[scheife-2015]]. A PDDI representation should cite specific supporting
      evidence items and provide some acceptable appraisal of the total body of evidence [[tilson-2016]].
    </p>
    <p>
      Unstructured narratives may also fail to provide critical information in computable form suitable for creation
      of personalized decision support presentation. The interaction described above notes that the mechanism of the
      interaction involves gastroduodenal irritation by the NSAID, suggesting gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a possible
      consequence. Such an occurrence would seem unlikely to occur for NSAIDs administered topically rather than orally.
      However, this constraint on the applicability of this PDDI is not stated implicitly: the formulation of the NSAID
      being described is ambiguous, and the importance of the means of administration is implied, but not stated directly.
      Describing PDDI evidence in terms of drugs in established drug terminologies, such as RxNorm
      (<a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/</a>), will reduce ambiguity and enable computation through rules
      and inference used to turn the PDDI descriptions into actionable content for clinical decision support.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elements of the minimum information model demonstrate that, despite the readability of the example
      PDDI narrative, the information provided lacks both the structure and semantics necessary for effective
      decision support. Problems like these are not unique to the French Interactions médicamenteuses.
      For example, a search for the same Oral Anticoagulant / NSAID interaction executed at the drug
      ingredient level in the freely accessible database  DrugBank returns a single statement that vaguely
      describes the clinical effect but with no other information from the core items mentioned above:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">“Ibuprofen may increase the anticoagulant activities of Warfarin.”</p>
    <p>
      As <a href="#COUMADIN-warfarin-product-label"></a> shows,
      slightly more information is provided in United States drug
      product labeling than in DrugBank but there are still many
      information gaps relative to the core PDDI information items
      suggested by conference series attendees (Bristol-Myers Squibb
      2017).
    </p>
    <figure id="COUMADIN-warfarin-product-label">
      <img src="W3C-Images/warfarin-product-label.png">
      <figcaption>An oral Anticoagulant / NSAID PDDI shown at the drug ingredient level
        from the United States drug product label for COUMADIN- warfarin sodium tablet (Bristol-Myers Squibb 2017). </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Although missing information is the primary concern for the examples discussed, the minimum information
      model would also increase the utility of narratives that are abundant with information. For example, a
      search for oral anticoagulant / NSAID in the online interaction checking tool provided by Drugs.com returns
      a very detailed narrative that includes mention of clinical effect, mechanism, management options, some
      contextualized risk information, and specific citations of evidence (Drugs.com search 3/31/17). In this
      case, the minimum information model would be useful for suggesting how to provide structure and semantics
      to the description to best enable clinical decision support systems through the use of coded drugs names,
      clinical consequences, and contextual information and modifying factors.  The provision of these details
      in a standardized, computable form will facilitate integration of PDDI information with data in a patient's
      electronic health record, thus enabling patient-specific alerting and decision support.

          <li>A PDDI with a known, pharmacokinetic mechanism:  Warfarin + 2C9 inhibitors (metronidazole)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
          Patrick is a nursing home consultant pharmacist who is reviewing the

            woman</span> who is being transferred back to her skilled nursing facility
          after a hospital admission for a Clostridium difficile (C. diff)
          infection; prior to the hospital admission, she was prescribed
          warfarin at the skilled nursing facility for <span style="background-color: #d0c7e3">deep vein thrombosis
            (DVT) treatment</span>.  Based on the hospital discharge summary, it
          appears that Nancy was taken off of the warfarin at the hospital
          due to an increased INR, and returned to the skilled nursing
          facility without an order for warfarin.  Patrick sees that a
          potential interaction may occur with the warfarin that Nancy
          had been prescribed prior to her hospitalization, and the
          metronidazole now used to treat her infection, since
          <span style="background-color: #a9d098">metronidazole is a CYP2C9 inhibitor and may increase the

          both the warfarin and the metronidazole, her current risk factors
          for a DVT, and if she is indicated for prophylactic therapy.
          Patrick also wants to know <span style="background-color: #dfa99f">if and when warfarin should be restarted,
            and at what dose, in order to reduce the risk of bleeding due to
            the interaction</span>.  He would also like to know <span style="background-color: #dfa99f">if metronidazole is
            the best option to continue treating Nancy’s C. diff infection,
            or if there is an alternative option that may not interact with
            warfarin</span>.  To gather this information, he reviews Nancy’s
          previous INR values, medication list, and history.  He also
            contacts the hospital to determine whether warfarin
          had been given at any point during Nancy’s stay, if the dosage
          had been adjusted, what other medications she was given, and if
          any of her other medications were discontinued.  He reviews
          his company’s intranet resources for additional information about

  <h2>Knowledge representation for the minimal information model</h2>

The wide range of potential use cases for the information model
requires flexibility in the knowledge representation. Moreover, the
  number of pre-existing ontologies relevant to this domain clearly
  demonstrates the richness of the domain [[herrero-zazo-2015]]. To
  keep the minimum information model lean and ensure its
  maintainability and usability, it was necessary to develop a clear
  scope for the knowledge representation including 
issues such as:

<ul>
  <li> How should terms related to the core information items
  (see <a href="#user-centered-def"></a>) be modeled?</li>

  <li>What is the role of an upper ontology?</li>
  
  <li>What is the relationship between  the core information items and other existing ontologies?</li>

  <li>Should terms from other resources, such as medical terminologies, be reused?</li>

</ul>

The following strategies are suggested for the representation of PDDI
minimal information (see <a href="#kr-process-apdx"></a> for a
description of the process used to develop these recommendations):

<ol>
  <li>The Minimum PDDI Information Ontology
      (<a href="https://github.com/MPIO-Developers/MPIO"
      target="new">MPIO</a>) should be used for the core information
      items relevant to the PDDI domain (see 
      Section <a href="#user-centered-def"></a>). The ontology is
      limited in its semantic richness by design, but remains
      compatible with semantically rich models such as <a target="new"
      href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/dideo.owL"> the Drug-drug
      Interaction and Drug-drug Interaction Evidence Ontology
      (DIDEO)</a> and <a target="new"
      href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/dinto.owl">the Drug-Drugs
      Interaction Ontology (DINTO)</a>.
  </li>
  <li> The MPIO is written in
      the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/">Web Ontology
      Language (OWL 2)</a> [[owl2-overview]]. The individual classes
      in the MPIO are sub-classes of classes provided by
      the <a href="https://github.com/bfo-ontology/BFO/wiki"> Basic
      Formal Ontology (BFO)</a> upper ontology. This enables
      integration with numerous other ontologies written in OWL 2 that
      use the same upper ontology. This approach fosters integration
      with a number of existing formal ontology efforts including
      DIDEO, DINTO, <a href="http://obi-ontology.org/"
      target="new">Ontology for Biomedical Investigations</a>, and
      the <a href="http://www.oae-ontology.org/"> Ontology of Adverse
      Events</a>.


  </li>
  <li>The core PDDI information items in the MPIO are
       all <a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000030">information
       content entities</a>. This approach is chosen to reflect the
       hypothetical nature of the information represented. As
       abstract descriptions of events and relationships that might occur,
       instances of the PDDI model do not make any claims that these
       interactions must actually exist.  However, as OWL models are
       generally interpreted to discuss objects that exist in the
       world, knowledge representations must take care to avoid
       making these claims of any of the PDDI information. To addres
       this problem, MPIO classifies items in the minimal information
       model as <em>information content entities</em>, essentially
       saying that they are &quot;about some thing&quot; Thus, each
       element of the model essentially exists as a statement about
       the PDDI.  As a result, the OWL 2 entities do not
      refer to the actual material entities or processes. Rather, all
      properties of the core information items are terminological in
      nature and refer to relations between the term and other
      terms. For example, the core term <a>Mechanism of
      Interaction</a> does not represent an entity that has
      participants or is preceded by another biological process. Those
      would be properties of material processes that would be invoved
       if the interaction were actually realized. Instead, the MPIO
      term <a>Mechanism of Interaction</a> is an information
      content entity provides information about those material
      processes. It is up to other ontologies, such as DIDEO or DINTO,
      to provide a detailed representation of the underlying
      biomedical processes, qualities, and material entities.  These
      representations will be complementary to the core information
      items in MPIO.
  </li>
  <li>An important requirement of the PDDI minimum information model
      is that it allow for integration of terms from existing
      biomedical terminologies such as ICD-10, SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, and
      LOINC. This presents a challenge since these terminologies
      represent similar items at different levels of semantic richness,
      methodological rigor, and semantic commitments. While it is
      highly unlikely that it would be possible to unify all external
      terms semantically at an upper level with the core PDDI
      information items (see
      Section <a href="#user-centered-def"></a>), terms for which a
      human understandable, non-circular, definition exist, MAY be 
      re-used in the MPIO. Re-use SHALL be accomplished by
      representing an information content entity about the object
      referenced by the term. For example, the diagnosis referred to
      by a diagnostic code from ICD 10 would be reused in the MPIO by
      representing an information content entity corresponding to the
      ICD 10 code. Practically speaking, concepts from any of the
      terminologies might be used, but they should represented
      whenever possible by unambiguous identifiers for both the source
      terminology and the specific concept.

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    The information provided in this Community Group Note provides a
    concrete, user centered, basis for design and implementation
    activities for the PDDI minimum information model. Twelve user
    stories with related goals show how the PDDI minimum information
    model would support various users
    (see <a href="#spec-user-stories"></a>).  Detailed descriptions of
    more than a dozen PDDIs, including specific clinical contexts,
    were constructed (see <a href="#decision-trees"></a>). Non-ambiguous definitions
    were created for PDDI core information items and implemented in a
    new an open source ontology (see
    Sections <a href="#user-centered-def"></a>
    and <a href="#KR-discussion"></a>). Two example PDDIs were
    annotated with the core information items along with detailed
    recommendations (see
    Sections <a href="#ex-warfarin-nsaids"></a>
    and <a href="#ex-tki-ppi"></a>. A subset of the user stories and
    selected PDDIs were integrated into three medication
    reconciliation use cases (see Section
    <a href="#med-rec-use-cases"></a>).

    The next sub-sections provide a discussion of three potential
    applications of the minimum information that are shown

    <h2>Shareable PDDI Clinical Decision Support Using HL7 Standards </h2>
    <p>
      The creation and maintenance of PDDI clinical decision support
      (CDS) generally requires considerable time and energy from
      highly trained domain experts. An additional need is to
      standardize the electronic health records context that is used
      to trigger CDS services. This can include context parameters
      that currently might not available but that, if present, would
      be useful for increasing the specificity of the PDDI CDS
      alerts. Achieving this sort of standardization is important to
      ensure that PDDI decision support can be implemented across a
      variety of systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) provides a
      possible solution to the challenge of seamless information
      exchange and data interoperability of information resources in
      health care related environments
      [[bender-2013]][[mandel-2016]]. FHIR  provides a collection of 
      specifications for resources 
      in healthcare settings for the purpose of overcoming the data
      exchange challenges in healthcare.  FHIR defines a set of
      standardized data models for health care covering key areas
      including Clinical information, Diagnostics, and
      Medications. For instance, the Medication resource contains
      medication codes, ingredient details, packaging information and
      related information. FHIR resources are API-based, making it
      possible for third party systems to access electronic health
      records data for the purpose of supporting new use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      FHIR encodings of PDDI information could form the basis of
      information exchange for more standardized PDDI clinical
      decision support. Indeed, a
      new <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=PDDI_CDS"
      target="new"> HL7 project related to PDDI decision support</a>
      has been recently approved by the
      HL7 <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Clinical_Decision_Support_Workgroup"
      target="new">Clinical Decision Support</a>
      and <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Pharmacy_WG"
      target="new">Pharmacy Workgroups</a>. The project seeks to
      develop an implementation guide for PDDI CDS that will specify
      both a knowledge representation format for PDDI logic and CDS
      services for PDDI with electronic health record (EHR)
      systems. Specifically, the implementation guide will include
      specifications for:

      <ol>
	<li>How to represent PDDI logic in the
	  HL7 <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Clinical_Quality_Language"
	  target="new">Clinical Quality Language</a> (CQL) using the FHIR Clinical Reasoning
	  module.</li>
	<li>How to use the emerging <a href="https://cds-hooks.org/"
	   target="new">CDS Hooks</a> standard as a mechanism for
	   electronic health records to request PDDI CDS from CDS
	   services.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      As is stated in
      the <a href="https://github.com/HL7/PDDI-CDS/blob/master/Documents/ProjectScopeStatement/PDDI%20CDS%20PSS%2002-15-2018.docx?raw=true"
      target="new">project's scope statement</a>, the HL7 PDDI CDS
      project will draw from the technical foundation, PDDI
      information, and user centered design artifacts reported in this
      Community Group Note. It is anticipated that representation of
      PDDI minimal information may  require the creation of new FHIR
      resource(s) (e.g., a resource       to represent drug
      interactions) and/or FHIR profile(s) (e,g, for 
      PDDI context representation). At the time of this writing,
      participation in the PDDI CDS project is open to public
      participation. Person interested in participation can find more

    <h2>Enhancing the Drug-drug Interaction Section of Structured Product Labeling</h2>
    <p>
      Serious consequences for patients could result if information
      about known drug interactions is missing from a drug’s product
      labeling. To address this potential risk, the United States Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated in 2006 that all product
      labels for FDA-approved prescription drugs include clinically
      significant interactions (c.f., CFR 21 201.57(c)(8)), as well as
      the results of pharmacokinetic studies that establish the
      absence of effect (c.f., CFR 21 201.57(c)(13)(C)) (Code of
      Federal Regulations Title 21). Similar requirements have been
      enacted by the European Medicine's Agency for their equivalent
      of product labeling
      called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3248251/"
      target="new">Summary of Product Characteristics</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned in a previous section
      (see <a href="#overarching-use-case"></a>), drug product
      labeling can contain many gaps in information relative to the
      core PDDI information. Other prior work has shown that many
      known PDDIs are not mentioned in drug labels [[boyce-2013]]. This problem is not unique to United States
      labeling. For instance, Pfistermeister et al. reported that
      critical drug–drug interaction warnings are frequently missing,
      or are mentioned inconsistently in the United States, United
      Kingdom, and German labels of the involved drugs [[pfistermeister-2014]].
    </p>
    <p>
      As is shown <a href="#PDDI-MI-APPLICATIONS"></a>, the PDDI
      minimum information model could help address this issue by making PDDI information reported in product labeling more
      complete and clinically useful. In the United States and other
      parts of the world, the content of a drug's product label is
      written by the company that owns the drug as part of the drug
      approval process. There is currently no information model to
      guide product label authors as they write drug interaction
      information. The PDDI minimum information model could provide
      authors with clear guidance on the core information items that
      they should discuss. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach might require an annotation tool to help authors
      tag the core PDDI information items correctly and
      consistently. Once the PDDI information is authored using the
      minimum information model, it could be published in a
      computer readable format. In the United States, this would 
      currently be accomplished using
      the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/"
      target="new"> Structured Product Label (SPL)</a> standard. Other
      standards, such as
      the <a href="http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/general/general_content_001849.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac0580bf85bb"
      target="new"> International Organization for Standardization
      (ISO) for the identification of medicinal products (IDMP)</a>
      serve a similar function outside of the United States. Focusing
      on the United States as case study, SPLs are XML documents
      written using the HL7 SPL specification that the FDA requires
      industry to use when submitting drug product label content (FDA
      2005). The
      HL7 <a href="https://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/rcrim/overview.cfm"
      target="new">Biomedical Research and Regulation</a> developed
      and maintains the SPL standard. Currently, the SPLs for all drug
      products marketed in the United States are available for
      download from the National Library of Medicine's DailyMed
      resource (National Library of Medicine 2017). At the time of
      this writing, DailyMed provides access to drug product labeling
      for more than 30,000 prescription products.
    </p>
    <p>
      PDDI information annotated using the minimum information model
      could be published in a computer readable format using what is
      called an SPL <i>supplemental       indexing
      file</i>. Supplemental indexing files provide additional useful
      information augmenting official FDA drug  SPLs. Currently,
      supplemental indexing is used to specify pharmacologic classes,
      billing units, warning letter alerts, and other information
      (National Library of Medicine 2017). Supplemental indexing files
      including the elements of the  PDDI minimum information model
      might be stored in XML and, trough the use of XSL and XSLT,
      be used to render the data in various formats including HTML,
      and PDF, and character-delimited tables.

    <h2>Highlighting and Filling Gaps in Evidence Needed to Develop PDDI Decision Support</h2>
    <p>
      Existing PDDI knowledge is heterogeneous with respect to
      coverage of the core information elements. For example,
      frequency of exposure and frequency of harm evidence was not
      available for either of the two PDDI examples detailed in this
      Note (see Sections <a href="#ex-warfarin-nsaids"></a>
      and <a href="#ex-tki-ppi"></a>). Other examples of knowledge
      gaps are mentioned in Appendix <a href="#decision-trees"></a>,
      such as the poorly understood mechanism of the PDDI between
      warfarin and Ifosfamide/Etoposide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the reason that there are many knowledge gaps is that
      many drug interactions are identified in case reports or
      observational studies that provide little or no indication of
      causal mechanisms. Other interactions, especially
      pharmacokinetic interactions, are established based on small
      clinical studies that rarely suggest a clinical
      consequence. Still other interactions might be inferred from the
      pharmacodynamic properties of two drugs, leaving unanswered
      questions about contextual factors that might increase or
      mitigate patient risks. Moreover, gaps in knowledge can exist
      about the risk factors or appropriate management options for a
      given interaction, even when solid evidence is available for its
      existence, the mechanism of its occurrence, and the likely
      clinical consequence from exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information model can also act as a template for drug
      epxperts to use while synthesizing PDDI evidence. As the experts
      compile evidence for each of the core information
      categories, critical gaps in knowledge will become apparent.
      These gaps might be used to develop prioritized research agendas
      aimed at providing evidence for clinical recommendations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, the PDDI model might be used to address knowledge
      gaps through the creation of computable cohort descriptions —
      serialized queries that  combine  concept sets with logical
      operations to extract specific patient sub-populations from a
      clinical data repository. Computable cohort descriptions are a
      cornerstone for research on PDDIs using real world data. A
      recent project showed the feasibility of converting PDDI
      descriptions created as part of this Note to  computable cohort
      definitions [[rosko-2017]]. The target for 
      translation was the Atlas clinical research tool created by the
      Observational Data Health and Informatics collaborative. Atlas
      has a powerful interface for creating, running, and sharing
      cohort descriptions [[ohdsi-atlas]]. Once created, the
      cohort descriptions were executed over a clinical dataset for a
      simulated population stored in the OHDSI common data model. The
      code, concept sets, and cohort descriptions for the
      demonstration are stored
      in <a href="https://github.com/dbmi-pitt/iDIA_Rules">a GitHub
      repository</a>
      and <a href="https://github.com/dbmi-pitt/docker-iDIA-Rules">Docker

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This Community Group Note provides motivation and a detailed
    domain analysis for a minimum information model for PDDI
    information. The Note also suggests potential applications of the
    minimum information model that could lead to improvements in
    patient safety with respect to PDDIs. The overarching goal of
    these contributions is to provide a technical foundation for
    effective PDDI clinical decision support. A reference
    implementation of the information model is the subject of future
    work.

    <h2>Development Process</h2>

    <p>Toward the goal of developing such a model, a volunteer-based Task Force force was formed by the Health
      Care and Life Sciences Interest Group, an interest group that operates publicly through the World Wide
      Web Consortium (W3C).  This Task Force has taken a user-centered design approach to designing the
      minimal information model through the a series of complementary activities:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Development of decision trees of more than a dozen PDDIs to
	represent  using the new information model.</li>
      <li>Creation of user stories and use cases that define the
        requirements for the minimum information model.</li>
      <li>Definition of guidelines for knowledge representation</li>
    </ol>

      <h2>Decision Trees</h2>
    <section id="selecting-PDDIs">
      <h2>Selecting PDDIs to implement using the minimum information
	model</h2>

      <p>Prior work by some members of the Task Force has sought to develop evidence-based clinical
        algorithms that consider a patient’s electronic health record information to provide a clinician
        with actionable information tailored to the patient’s specific context. <sup>1</sup>The algorithms are formulated
        as decision trees to provide concise information including the interaction description, the purported
        mechanism and possible effects, the evidence supporting the mechanism and effects along with citations
        listed in the footnotes. Two sample decision trees illustrating the management options can be found in
        the appendix (see Appendix <a href="#decision-trees">DECISION TREES</a>).</p>
      <blockquote style="font-size: small"><sup>1</sup>The initial decision trees were developed through the “Individualized Drug Interaction Alerts”
        AHRQ grant by Task Force members Dan Malone and John Horn, as well as Phil Hansten (AHRQ Project: R21-HS023826-01;
        Title: Individualized Drug Interaction Alerts; Authors: Daniel C. Malone, University of Arizona; John Horn,
        Philip Hansten, University of Washington).</blockquote>
      <p>The Task Force built on this prior work by selecting PDDIs to demonstrate the new minimum
        information model and then creating decision trees for each of the PDDIs that they selected.
        Task Force drug experts selected the PDDIs and identified contextual information/modifying factors that
        would warrant any of three different recommended actions - <em>No special precautions, Assess risk and take action
          if necessary, and Use only if benefit outweighs risk</em>. Draft decision trees were presented during sub-team
        monthly meetings for thorough discussion. Revisions were made iteratively until the group reached consensus
        on the presented drafts and finalized the decision trees.</p>
      <p>
        The Task Force began with a discussion of how to select the PDDIs for developing decision trees.
        One option was to select the most serious PDDIs. However, it was noted that the seriousness of a PDDI
        depends a great deal on the patient characteristics context. This meant that it would be difficult to
        identify PDDIs that were considered the most serious in all clinical settings and for all patients. An
        alternative approach was to choose PDDIs that would allow the Task Force to demonstrate how the
        information model should be used when facing known issues with PDDI evidence and knowledge. Toward that
        aim, participants were requested to provide suggestions of PDDIs meeting at least one or more of the
        following criteria which follow from the aforementioned information categories suggested by attendees
        of the multi-stakeholder conference meetings/series mentioned in Section <a href="#justification"></a>:

      <h2>Example PDDI:Warfarin + NSAIDs (Draft)></h2>
      <p>
        Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have antiplatelet effects which
        increase the bleeding risk when combined with oral anticoagulants such as warfarin.
        The antiplatelet effect of NSAIDs lasts only as long as the NSAID is present in the
        circulation, unlike aspirin’s antiplatelet effect, which lasts for up to 2 weeks
        after aspirin is discontinued. NSAIDs also can cause peptic ulcers and most of the
        evidence for increased bleeding risk with NSAIDs plus warfarin is due to upper
        gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

            <li style="text-align: left">If the NSAID is being used as an analgesic or antipyretic, it would be prudent to use an alternative such as acetaminophen. In some people, acetaminophen can increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, so monitor the INR if acetaminophen is used in doses over 2 g/day for a few days. For more severe pain consider short-term opioids in place of the NSAID.</li>

      <h2>Workflow for arriving at stories and goals</h2>
      <p>
        User stories and goals were developed in order to showcase how the PDDI minimum information model
        will support users. The Task Force began developing the Stakeholder Description document and
        the PDDI Minimum Information Model User Scenarios document in order to identify key users. These
        stakeholder descriptions and user scenarios were used as the basis for further brainstorming with
        the assistance of a user experience expert to develop a master list of tasks, users, information needs,
        information values, and barriers to drug-drug interaction based decision-making in a variety of situations.
        A core set of user types was selected for development of user stories based on the scope of the minimum
        information model. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To develop the user stories for the core user types, Task Force  members created an
        initial information needs list  and then was supplemented it with user interviews, interview transcripts
        collected as a part of a recently published manuscript on PDDI information needs of drug information
        compendium editors [[romagnoli-2017]], and the published literature. Where possible, user stories
        were based on PDDIs suggested by the Task Force’s PDDI experts. All user stories were reviewed
        during team meetings to solicit feedback and comments. Based on Task Force member suggestions,
        the user stories were edited to make them more clinically relevant, accurate and appropriate. Information
        model items were highlighted based on a color-coded key to indicate the minimum information model
        information item in question.

            for clinicians to improve healthcare quality. Richard is professionally
            trained in algorithms, databases, and programming. He also has some
            knowledge about electronic medical records. In order to help Richard
            design and implement the system, Joe would like to know about the
            <span style="background-color: #bed1f6">evidence</span>,
            <span style="background-color: #fee087">clinical consequences</span>, and
            <span style="background-color: #a9d098">mechanisms of interactions</span> of
            potential drug-drug interactions so that he can develop rules for
            the most clinically relevant interactions. With that information,
            he can help Richard create linkages and designs algorithms based
            on electronic medical records. Joe can also help Richard prioritize
            what to display and how to display information or alerts for clinicians.</li>

    <h2>Definition of guidelines for knowledge representation</h2>
    
    <font color="grey">A sub-team of the task force focused on setting the scope of
    knowledge representation for the minimum information model. A
    series of teleconferences bringing together domain experts,
    biomedical informatics specialists, and knowledge representation
    experts across the task force. Starting with a core set of
    questions, topics were discussed, arguments for different
    approaches were laid out and, agreement among the participants was
    sought. Besides the conversation during the teleconferences,
    participants had the opportunity to add comments and voice their
    opinion to the statements in the document. When the task force
    arrived at a consolidated version, the group voted by
    teleconference and through e-mail. The result of that vote was
    written into a draft document. The final version of the document
    was revised and written as Section <a href=""#KR-discussion""></a>
      of this document.

    <h2>Proposed XML Examples</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this note is to describe the content of
    the PDDI minimal information model, leaving representational
      issues to be resolved in an anticipated future note.
    Any eventual representation models will rely heavily on
    existing ontologies and relevant models such as FHIR
    [[bender-2013]][[mandel-2016]].  Specifically, as medications may be
    represented with a variety of codes, we propose using a
    representation similar to
    FHIR's <A HREF="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#CodeableConcept">CodeableConcept</a>,
    which will allow for clear an unambiguous representation of
    medications thorugh reference to established vocabularies, without
    requiring the use of any single vocabulary.
								
    <p>Here, we present straw man XML representations of two example
    PDDIs.   As representational issues have not been
    fully resolved, these examples should be considered informative
    (not normative) and subject to revision.</p>

	‘Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have antiplatelet effects which increase the bleeding risk when combined with oral anticoagulants such as warfarin. The antiplatelet effect of NSAIDs lasts only as long as the NSAID is present in the circulation, unlike aspirin’s antiplatelet effect, which lasts for up to 2 weeks after aspirin is discontinued. NSAIDs also can cause peptic ulcers and most of the evidence for increased bleeding risk with NSAIDs plus warfarin is due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).’

	‘If the NSAID is being used as an analgesic or antipyretic, it would be prudent
	to use an alternative such as acetaminophen. In some people, acetaminophen can increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, so monitor the INR if acetaminophen is used in doses over 2 g/day for a few days. For more severe pain consider short-term opioids in place of the NSAID.’
